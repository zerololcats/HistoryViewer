## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) for a minimalist dark theme.
- Primary color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) to ensure good contrast with the dark background, while still maintaining a calm, subdued presence.
- Accent color: Pale gold (#D4A373). A gentle accent helps draw the eye without disrupting the quiet design of the interface.
- Font: 'Inter' sans-serif for both headings and body, for a clean and modern aesthetic.
- Use a clean, minimalist layout with clear visual separation between timeline events.
- Simple, geometric icons to represent different categories of events. To keep the aesthetic quiet, use icons with a 'stroke' rather than 'filled' style.
- Subtle animations for transitions and interactions, such as card hover effects and modal appearance.
